# IBM Data Science Capstone

This capstone is the 10th course in the IBM data science module on Coursera. This project tests all of the materials from the previous courses.

## Project Background
Space X advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against space X for a rocket launch. Therefore we create a machine learning pipeline to predict if the first stage will land.
